Today, we are going to learn about the Core Types or Core Data Types or Data Types inside TypeScript.

1) Number : 
   eg - 1, 10, 100, 2.5

2) String :
   eg - 'hi', "Hello", `ok`

3) Boolean :
   eg - true or false

Rest we can still make arrays, objects, classes, interfaces, generics, etc. We have 3 core data types.


Also, we cannot open both the .js and .ts files together/simultaneously. We need to close one of them before, as it will give an error that the variable has already been specified.
