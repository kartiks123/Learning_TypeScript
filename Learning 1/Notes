1) Typescript is an enhanced version of JavaScript.
2) Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.
    - Just like C++ is an enhanced version of C language.
3) TypeScript is building on JS.
4) TS is not a new Language, this is just added with some new features in JS.


But TS cannot run on browser directly.
Q) So the question comes of what is the benefit of it then, if we can't even run it on browser? 
A) TS Compiler convert the code from TS to JS. Now this JS code runs the code in browser.

Q) But then in that case, why we just can't simply run and use JS, why we are using TS ?
A) We run and use TS because of the following features :
    1) We can check error on Compile time.
    2) We can add types like String, Number, Bool, etc.
    3) We can also add OOPS with TS.
    4) Code is well managed.
